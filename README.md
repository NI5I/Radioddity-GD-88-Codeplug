# Radioddity GD-88 Codeplug
 Here is a codeplug for Mississippi Hams courtesy of George County ARES Team.

## Introduction
This codeplug was developed for a fellow member of the George County ARES team. I will be adding to this codeplug during the coming weeks as I now have purchased one of these radios.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any requests.

## Features
George County codeplug:
 - 64 Channels
 - 30 Talk Groups
 - 3 Zones

Multi-Network Codeplug:
 - 1247 Channels
 - 1173 Talk Groups
 - 65 Zones
 - George County, Stone County and Hattiesburg zones
 - We are looking for assistance to add your county.
 
## Use
Enter your call sign and DMR ID in the codeplug.

All other settings are at Factory Defaults.

Make sure that your radio is running the March 2023 Firmware Version
- A: B49E.D6T.E0PSAB.013
- B: B49C.D6T.EHRNAB.008

## Hotspot
I have programmed the Hotspot frequency at 438.8000.

Using your favorite text editor, you can do a search for `438800000` and replace it with the frequency of your hotspot. 

This codeplug doesn't place a decimal in the frequency.
