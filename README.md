# Radioddity-GD-88-Mississippi-Codeplug
 George County Mississippi Codeplug for Radioddity GD-88

## Introduction
This codeplug was developed for a fellow member of the George County ARES team. I will be adding to this codeplug during the coming weeks as I now have purchased one of these radios.

I will probably build this codeplug to be quite similar to the AnyTone codeplug I have in another project.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any requests.

## Features
This is the initial version of the codeplug.
 - 35 Channels
 - 29 Talk Groups
 - 2 Zones
 
 Yeah, I know. Pretty spartan. More's coming.
 
## Use
Enter your call sign and DMR ID in the codeplug.

Make sure that your radio is running the March 2023 Firmware Version
- A: B49E.D6T.E0PSAB.013
- B: B49C.D6T.EHRNAB.008

## Hotspot
I have programmed the Hotspot frequency at 446.1875.

You can do a search for `44618750` and replace it with the frequency of your hotspot. This codeplug doesn't place a decimal in the frequency for some reason.
